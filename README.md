# LoadingPictures
openvr program to show your vrchat pictures as a slideshow while in the loading screen.<br>
I don't recommend using this yet. I put this together in a few hours.. I will add a screenshot of it working and a official release after I fix the bugs in the next few days.

### Bugs (I'll fix these soon)
* vertical images are squished
* blocks vrchat "Go" button sometimes (depending of user's actual height)

### Note
Made using [OVRLay](https://github.com/benotter/OVRLay)
