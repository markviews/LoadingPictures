# LoadingPictures
openvr program to show your vrchat pictures as a slideshow while in the loading screen.<br>
<br>
I don't recommend using this yet. I put this together in a few hours.. I will add a screenshot of it working and a official release after I fix the bugs in the next few days.<br>

### Bugs (I'll fix these soon)
* Currently the pictures spawn in front of where you are looking when you enter the loding screen so if you were looking in a strange position they will be stuck there.. Including potentially blocking the "Go" or "Go home" buttons.

### Note
Made using [OVRLay](https://github.com/benotter/OVRLay)
